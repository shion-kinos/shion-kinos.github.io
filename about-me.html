        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Shion.</p>
        <h2>A note about my studies</h2>
        <p>I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, but I'm currently on an indefinite break from my studies. There are a few reasons for this, but essentially I realized that the path I was on is probably not the right one for me, and that trying to force my way through it was taking a toll on my mental health, so I've decided to take some time to figure out a better path forward.</p>
        <h2>My involvement in the local community</h2>
        <p>I'm very passionate about helping people in need and I regularly do volunteer work at organizations dedicated to supporting vulnerable populations in my area.</p>
        <p>I recently designed a pamphlet for one of the organizations I'm involved in â€” you can check it out <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P5-FfLb24tfv679ZZMt2sLaXWrXSRVzs/view?usp=sharing">here</a> if you're interested. I created this pamphlet using HTML.</p>
        <h2>My interests and hobbies</h2>
        <p>I'm a language nerd. I love languages and linguistics. I'm bilingual in English and Japanese, and intermediate in French. I also have an interest in Chinese languages, particularly Cantonese and Classical Chinese. I enjoy digging into the archives of Japan's <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/" target="_blank">National Diet Library Digital Collections</a>, as well as looking at Classical Chinese texts on the <a href="https://ctext.org/" target="_blank">Chinese Text Project</a>. Sometimes I just get lost browsing online dictionaries. Languages really are endlessly fascinating.</p>
        <p>Another hobby of mine is coding. I used to write stuff in Python, but nowadays I mainly use HTML and JavaScript to create websites (like this one) and tools for my personal use. If I'm not careful, I'll end up coding for hours on end without eating or sleeping.</p>
        <p>I also like worldbuilding and science fiction. I recently started writing a sci-fi story. This is my first time writing fiction so I don't know how it'll turn out, but so far I'm enjoying it.</p>
        <p>I really like books. There are many books I want to read. Unfortunately, my ADHD makes it quite difficult for me to read consistently. Otherwise I'd totally be a massive bookworm... But I'm trying hard, and so far in 2025 I've managed to read 2 books from start to finish, which is 2 more than last year, so that's not too bad, I guess.</p>
        <h2>In the words of a friend...</h2>
        <p>"<i>Shion you are the kind of guy who I think understands many things but really enjoys being silly</i>"</p>

        <p>Indeed, this is the kind of person I aspire to be.</p>
