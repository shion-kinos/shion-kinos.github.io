        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Shion.</p>
        <h2>My interests and hobbies</h2>
        <p>I'm a language nerd. I love languages and linguistics. I'm fluent in English and Japanese, and intermediate in French. I also have an interest in Chinese languages, particularly Cantonese and Classical Chinese. I enjoy digging into the digital archives of Japan's national library and discovering old words that aren't found in modern dictionaries, as well as trying to decipher ancient Chinese philosophy texts and absorb their timeless wisdoms. Sometimes I just get lost browsing online dictionaries. Languages really are endlessly fascinating.</p>
        <p>Another hobby of mine is coding. I used to write stuff in Python, but nowadays I mainly use HTML and JavaScript to create websites (like this one) and tools for my personal use. If I'm not careful, I'll end up coding for hours on end without eating or sleeping.</p>
        <p>I also like worldbuilding and science fiction. I recently started writing a sci-fi story, and this is my main hobby at the moment.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about helping people in need and I regularly volunteer at local organizations dedicated to supporting vulnerable populations.</p>
        <h2>In the words of a friend...</h2>
        <p>"<i>Shion you are the kind of guy who I think understands many things but really enjoys being silly</i>"</p>

        <p>Indeed, this is the kind of person I aspire to be.</p>
